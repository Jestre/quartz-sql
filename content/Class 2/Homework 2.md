title: Homework - Class 2
---
For next class, start to populate your tables with enough data to make next week's session interesting.  Perhaps 5-10 asset types, and 50 - 100 people with those items.  Try to use a range of dates so that not every record has the same dates.

We'll be using the time next week to construct queries to answer the [[Homework 1#^e30f1c|sample questions]] posed last week, so start thinking about that (and coming up with any other questions you think a good asset system should be able to answer).
