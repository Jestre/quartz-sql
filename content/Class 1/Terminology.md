## Explanation of Common Terms

### Database / RDBMS
A relational database (RDB) is a collective set of multiple data sets organized by tables, records and columns. RDBs establish a well-defined relationship between database tables. Tables communicate and share information, which facilitates data searchability, organization and reporting.

RDBs use Structured Query Language (SQL), which is a standard user application that provides an easy programming interface for database interaction.

### Table
A table is a named relational database data set that is organized by rows and columns. The relational table is a fundamental relational database concept because tables are the primary form of data storage.

Columns form the tableâ€™s structure, and rows form the content. Tables allow restrictions for columns (i.e., allowed column data type) but not rows. Every database table must have a unique name.

### Tuple
In the context of relational databases, a tuple is one record (one row). The information in a database can be thought of as a spreadsheet, with columns (known as fields or attributes) representing different categories of information, and tuples (rows) representing all the information from each field associated with a single record.

### Fields / Attributes

The named columns of the database, e.g. "Name", "Address", etc. above.

### Schema

A database schema is the blueprint of how the database will be laid out, which attributes will be [[Other and etc#Keys|keys]] or [[Other and etc#Indexes|indexes]], and for the others, what naming scheme will be employed. It will help ensure that the layout makes sense before you actually start building the database on the server.
